# Catch The Ball
A simple Python game made purely with Tkinter, and some other dependencies.  

## How to install  
Just click the *Code* button at the top-right of the repo, then click *Download ZIP*.  
Then, just extract the ZIP to a folder, and make sure the <logo.ico> file and the <main.py> file are in the same place.  

You can run the game by running `python main.py` or `python3 main.py` in the PowerShell at the folder you put the files in.  
**Note:** To quit the game, you need to force-quit by closing the PowerShell window you ran the game with.
